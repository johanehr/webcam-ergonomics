DONE: 
- Include camera calibration in config file
- Include option to adjust IPD in config file
- Include option to adjust neutral position in config file
- Include option to adjust neutral position tolerances in config file (x, y, z)
- Include option to set count time until alert

TODO: 
- Find camera calibration parameters
- Generate and print basic estimate of head position based on eye positions in image (iff ONE head)
- Implement discrete LP-filter for x-, y-, and z-position of head to smoothen out jitter
- Implement detection of straying from neutral position (simple count down until alerted)
- Play small sound with increasing intensity (volume increases + period between beeps decreases)

FUTURE WORK: 
- GUI for adjusting settings in config file
- Option to adjust neutral position on the fly
