DONE:
- Include camera calibration in config file
- Include option to adjust IPD in config file
- Include option to adjust neutral position in config file
- Include option to adjust neutral position tolerances in config file (x, y, z)
- Include option to set count time until alert
- Integrate basic eye detection
- Refactor to OOP
- Color face/eye detection separately
- Implement averaging of x samples for x-, y-, and z-position of head to smoothen out jitter
- Implement detection of straying from neutral position (simple count down until alerted)
- Generate and print basic estimate of head position based on eye positions in image (iff ONE head)

TODO:
- Comment code
- Display position on live feed
- Find camera calibration parameters (see screenshot of method using field of view)
- Play small sound with increasing intensity (volume increases + period between beeps decreases)

FUTURE WORK:
- GUI for adjusting settings in config file
- Built-in option to calibrate camera (?)
- Option to adjust neutral position on the fly (button combo?)
- Eye fatigue, blinking rate
